# 👋 Hey! I'm Ángel Jesús Morando

I'm a 25-year-old guy from the south of Spain 🇪🇸 who’s been in love with computers since I was a kid.  
What started with curiosity and breaking things (oops 😅) turned into a passion for building stuff that works.

Currently, I’m working as a **Full Stack Developer** at [MetaMedicsVR](https://github.com/MetaMedicsVR-org), where I build web apps using **React + TypeScript** on the frontend and **Java + Spring Boot** on the backend. I’m also the guy behind our CI/CD pipelines (hello, **Jenkins**), managing Dockerized deployments and AWS infrastructure.

## 💻 A bit more about what I do

- 🔹 Frontend: `React`, `Vue3`, `TypeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`
- 🔹 Backend: `Java`, `Kotlin`, `Spring Boot`, `Spring AI`
- 🔹 DevOps: `Jenkins`, `Docker`, `AWS`, `GitHub`, `Cloudflare`
- 🔹 Databases: `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`, `Firebase`

But honestly, I just love solving problems, learning new tools, and making things work.

## 🕹️ When I’m not coding...

You'll probably find me:
- 🎮 Playing video games
- 🏋️‍♂️ Doing some sport or working out
- 🍿 Binge-watching a good series
- 🌊 Chilling somewhere near the sea (yep, Tarifa life 😎)

## 🚀 My Journey

From studying **Microcomputer Systems and Networks** at 20, to diving into **Multiplatform App Development**, my path has always been about leveling up—like a good ol' RPG.  
Now I’m combining all that knowledge to build cool things and grow as a developer, one commit at a time.
